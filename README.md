# odin-recipes 
This is my first project for The Odin Project's Foundations course. In this project, I'll be building a basic recipe website using only HTML.

The goal is to demonstrate my understandingof:
-Working with Git and GitHub
-Creating and structuring HTML firles
-Using relative links between pages
-Creating a clean and simple project strucure

By the end of this project, I'll have a multi-page website that displays a few recipes with images and steps, and it will be fully version-controlled with Git.
